# WallpaperBug - A WordPress Wallpaper Plugin
WallpaperBug is a plugin used to setup a wallpaper website. When yo upload a wallpaper, there are three available fields, each for a different aspect ratio (16:9, 16:10, 4:3). Upload the largest possible size for each aspect ratio as the plugin will only generate other sizes that are smaller than the original image.

If a certain aspect ratio is not avaliable, WallpaperBug will take one of the other uploaded images and crop it to the correct size.

See http://www.wallpaperbug.com for a live demo.
