# WallpaperBug - A WordPress Wallpaper Plugin
WallpaperBug is a plugin used to setup a wallpaper website. Each wallpaper has an option to upload three different aspect ratios of a wallpaper. Upload the largest possible size for each aspect ratio and the plugin will create several common sizes for each aspect ratio.

If a certain aspect ratio is not avaliable, WallpaperBug will take one of the other uploaded images and crop it to the correct size.

See http://www.wallpaperbug.com for a live demo.
